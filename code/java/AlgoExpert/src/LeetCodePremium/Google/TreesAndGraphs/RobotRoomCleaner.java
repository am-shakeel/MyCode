Given a robot cleaner in a room modeled as a grid.
Each cell in the grid can be empty or blocked.

The robot cleaner with 4 given APIs can move forward, turn left or turn right. Each turn it made is 90 degrees.
When it tries to move into a blocked cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle and it stays on the current cell.
Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using only the 4 given APIs shown below.
