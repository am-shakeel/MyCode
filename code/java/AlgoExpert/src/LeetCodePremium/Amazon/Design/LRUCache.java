/*
Implement the LRUCache class:
LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.

void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists.
Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache.
If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation,
evict the least recently used key.

Follow up:
Could you do get and put in O(1) time complexity?

Constraints:

1 <= capacity <= 3000
0 <= key <= 3000
0 <= value <= 104
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to get and put.
